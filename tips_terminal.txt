# General shell tips for beginners


- Your current directory is displayed in the shell prompt.
- ~ represents your home directory, which is a good place to store
  files you are working on. You can find your way back here at any time by
  typing cd ~. Files stored outside of your home directory will not
  persist between webshell sessions.

- Some files are too big to store in your home directory! If you need
  them to work on a challenge, try storing them in /tmp, but note that 
  they will not be persisted between webshell sessions.

- Type ls to list the files in the current directory.

- Type cd <path> to change the current directory to that path. Paths are
  relative to the current directory, or absolute if prefixed with /.
  Type cd .. to go up one level from the current directory.

- Type cat <file> to print the contents of a text file.

- Type ./<file> to run an executable file in the current directory.
  You may first need to grant yourself permission to execute it by
  typing chmod +x <file>.

- Type <Control-C> to terminate a running process.

- Type man <command> to learn more about any command. You can exit
  a manual page by pressing q.

- If your terminal prompt starts behaving strangely, type reset to
  clear the screen.

- You can end a webshell session by typing exit or by closing the tab.

# Tips for solving challenges


- Some challenges require downloading files. Rather than clicking the
  link, you can download the file into the webshell using wget, e.g.
  wget <file-URL>. Right-click the link to copy the file's URL.

- Some challenges require connecting to a remote port. This is generally
  done using netcat, e.g. nc <server-name> <port>. However, certain
  challenges may require the use of programs other than netcat.

- While most challenges are solvable using the webshell, some may be
  difficult or impossible without additional resources. For example,
  some challenges are intended to be solved using GUI programs.

- Exporting files from the webshell to the browser or vice versa
  is possible using sz <filename> / rz.


# Additional notes


- You can connect to the webshell from multiple tabs / devices, and they
  will share the same session. However, note that closing *any one*
  of these tabs will end your webshell session on all of them.

- If you see the message "Killed", a long-running process has been killed
  in order to ensure a fair distribution of resources to all players.
  Extensive brute-forcing is not necessary to solve picoCTF challenges.

- If you see other unexpected errors, you may be running into one of the
  webshell resource limits. Check the usage command, or, if necessary,
  end your current session using exit.

- If you change your username through the picoCTF website, you will
  have a newly created home directory the next time you sign into
  the webshell. However, files from your previous username are still
  accessible under /home/<old-username>.
